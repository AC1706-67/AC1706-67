## 🌍 What I'm Building

### 🔹 Recovery Haven
An AI-enhanced recovery platform providing secure check-ins, peer-to-peer support, and blockchain-backed progress tracking. Designed with **real people** in mind — built on **trust, healing, and tech**.

🔹 **Daily Haven App**  
A mobile check-in tool (kiosk + app) that helps participants reflect, track progress, and earn token-based rewards for showing up daily.

### 🔹 12x12x12 AI Learning Model
A peer-led AI literacy journey:
- **12 hours** to explore
- **12 days** to learn
- **12 weeks** to build
- **12 months** to master

📜 And in **12 years**, I will pass the torch to the next generation.  
This isn’t about me — it’s about the *movement*.

## 🌐 What's Coming

### 🔸 Recovery Commons
The long-term vision: a **global network** of recovery and mental health organizations sharing decentralized infrastructure, healing tools, and scalable models.

The **Recovery Commons** will be:
- A hub for RCOs, MH orgs, and behavioral health innovators
- Cross-chain, peer-first, spiritually inclusive
- A place where **no one heals alone**

## 🙏 Final Word

I’m not a developer by training.  
I started out **tech illiterate**, using AI just to help me type.  
Now I’m building tools that might change the way the recovery world works.

> I believe in second chances, third tries, and infinite grace.  
> If you do too — welcome to the Recovery Haven revolution.## Hi there 👋
